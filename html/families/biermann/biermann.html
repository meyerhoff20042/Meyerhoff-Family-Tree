            The Biermann family first arrived to the United States in the mid-1840s. Once settling in Randolph County, Illinois, the Biermanns quickly spread across
            the region as the family grew larger and larger. The first Biermanns in the U.S. were Heinrich Friedrich Biermann (1818-1915) and Sophie Dorothee
            Fischer (1812-1882) and their daughter Wilhelmina (1843-1925).
        </p>

        <p>
            Heinrich Friedrich Biermann was the fifth child and second son of Catharina Margarethe Hoermann (1778-1852) and Jürgen Heinrich Biermann (1777-1856),
            born December 20, 1818, in the town of Wenden in Hanover. I believe his other siblings were Catherine Dorothee Louise Biermann (1804-1873), Marie Catharina 
            Dorothee (Biermann) Hogrefe (1806-1873), Johann Heinrich Biermann (1811-1893), Sophie Dorothee Louise (Biermann) Runge (1814-1872), Catherine Dorothee Biermann 
            (Mar. 1821 - Apr. 1821), and Heinrich Christian Friedrich Biermann (1825-1896). Similar to the <a href="meyerhoff.html">Meyerhoff family</a>, all German records 
            of the Biermanns come from church baptism, marriage, and death records. Heinrich married Sophie Fischer on March 26, 1843, in the town of Husum in Hanover. Once 
            moving to Illinois he began farming in the Randolph County area. He passed away on September 13, 1915, in Welge, IL, at the age of 96, from pneumonia and cardiac failure.

        <p>
            Sophie Dorothee Charlotte Fischer was the daughter of Anna Katharina Hoffmaier (1776-????) and Johann Wilhelm Fischer (1777-1843), born November 16, 1814, in the town of
            Döhren in Hanover. She moved to the U.S. with her husband and daughter and raised their family on the Biermann farm. The couple celebrated 39 years of marriage when Sophie 
            passed away on March 4, 1882, in St. Louis, MO. The couple were buried in Saint John's Evangelical Lutheran Cemetery in Bremen, IL.

                Linsburg.
