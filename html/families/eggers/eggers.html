        <h1>~ The Eggers Family ~</h1>

        <p>The Eggers family immigrated to the United States from Germany sometime between 1850 and 1880. Heinrich A. Eggers, the patriarch of this family, is the oldest confirmed 
            relative I have on this side of the tree. Born December 24, 1849, in Sultan, Prussia, he is believed to have been the son of Marie Steinke and Hans Heinrich Eggers. Heinrich 
            married Sophie Margaretha Lehnhoff (1859-1927) on November 8, 1878, in Campbell Hill, IL, and together they had seven children listed below. Heinrich passed away on January 26, 
            1922, in Campbell Hill, at the age of 72. Sophie followed him in death five years later on February 22, 1927, in Randolph County, at the age of 67. They were buried in Saint 
            John Lutheran Cemetery in Campbell Hill.</p>
