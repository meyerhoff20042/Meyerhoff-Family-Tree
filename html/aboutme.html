            <p>My name is Braden Meyerhoff. I'm a big history nerd who found my love for genealogy in the process. I graduated high school in 2022 and am working towards an
                Associate's in Applied Science specializing in Computer Information Systems. My last semester at SWIC begins this August.

            <p>I first created my family tree on Family Echo in 2015, but began serious research in 2018. I frequented sites like Find A Grave and WikiTree to help grow the family tree project
                that I had had for three years. Through those sites, I learned more about my family than I had in three years of asking my relatives (they know quite a bit, but
                their memories only go so far). I created accounts for both WikiTree and FamilySearch and began contributing to the sites myself using some of the hints I 
                found through earlier research. Through FamilySearch, I was able to expand greatly upon my family tree as unlike Find A Grave and WikiTree, FamilySearch finds
                hints and helps you grow the world tree.</p>
            
            <p>As time went on, I became more experienced in my genealogy work and took a step backward. I looked at the research I had gathered and corrected many of the 
                research errors that I did not notice back when I first added them. Doing so shrunk my family tree a fair bit, but it gave me newfound confidence in my
                research and I still had a large tree backed by reliable sources.</p> 

            <p>This website is the culmination of many of my efforts to map out my family tree. It is designed to help relatives of mine explore their own ancestry
               and give them a great starting point.</p>
