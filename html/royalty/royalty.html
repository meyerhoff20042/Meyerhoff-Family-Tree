        <h1>~ Royal Families ~</h1>

        <p>The genealogy of royal families became an interest of mine around 2019. I think it's fascinating how we are able to connect essentially every European imperial, royal,
            and noble family due to strategic marriages and a low gene pool. The way titles pass through families has always been an interest of mine as well.
        </p>

        <p>The first royal family I studied was the British royal family as that is the one most relevant to my genealogical research. If you're an American with ancestors
            who lived in the British Colonies, there is a very good chance you are descended from medieval royalty, likely from at the latest King John, who ruled from
            1199 to 1216.
        </p>

        <p>Right now I plan to show the history of a country's royal family and how each monarch was related to their successor. I will highlight  the houses that they
            were a part of along with extra circumstances that changed who inherited the throne.
