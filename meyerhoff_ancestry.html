        <h2><center>Meyerhoff Origins</center></h2>

        <strong><center>Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia</center></strong>

        <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Saxony">Lower Saxony</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Rhine-Westphalia">North Rhine-Westphalia</a> are two modern German states that the 
            Meyerhoff ancestors on my family tree originated from. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanover_Region">Hanover region</a> in particular shows up frequently in my research. 
            In the timeframe given in the tree, the Hanover region was known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hanover">Kingdom of Hanover</a>, which was in a 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_union_of_Great_Britain_and_Hanover">personal union</a> with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain">Kingdom
            of Great Britain</a> under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Hanover">House of Hanover</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            While Hanover was where many of the Meyerhoff ancestors originated from, the other places mentioned in the <i>Meyerhoff Family Tree</i> indicates that several parts of Carl's ancestors
            lived in the boundaries of the complicated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>. They lived during many tumultuous periods of 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance">Renaissance</a> and Baroque Europe, witnessing firsthand the consequences of the 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformation">Reformation</a> that had begun in 1517 and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment">Age of Enlightenment</a>.
            In particular, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Years%27_War">Thirty Years' War</a>, one of the most destructive conflicts in European history, saw a lot of fighting in
            the regions where the Meyerhoffs lived.
        </p>

        <p>
            There was a massive wave of German immigration to the United States in the mid-19th century, where many families, including many that are mentioned on this website,
            migrated primarily to the Midwest. This was in response to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1848">Revolutions of 1848</a>, when, in Germany,
            after the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forty-eighters">Forty-Eighters</a>" lost the German revolution. Many of these Forty-Eighters sought refuge in the U.S.
            Indeed, it was in the mid-19th century when the Meyerhoffs moved into the Randolph County, IL, area.

        <h2><center>The Name "Meyerhoff"</center></h2>

        <p>
            I have looked a bit into where the name Meyerhoff might originate from. I've looked on sites like Ancestry to find <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/name-origin?surname=meyerhoff">potential origins</a>. According to many sites, the name Meyerhoff
            was a "habitational name for someone who lived or worked at a farm named Meyerhof." When looking for Meyerhofs, here's what I found:
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Meierhof/Meyerhof:</b> In Germany, there was a building called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meierhof">Meierhof</a>, which, according to Wikipedia, "was occupied by the
            administrator (or <i>meier</i>) of a noble or ecclesiastical estate." The name <i>Meyerhof</i> comes from the Latin words <i>maiores villae</i>. Perhaps that is the oldest known origin
            of the name Meyerhoff. Translated to English, it means "the elders of the town".
        </p>

        <p>With this in mind, here is my final theory on the origin of the name Meyerhoff:</p>

        <p><center><b>Maiores Villae (the elders of the town) ==> Meierhof ==> Meyerhoff</b></center></p>

        <p><b>What does this mean?</b> Potentially, a medieval Meyerhoff family might have lived in a Meierhof and worked as overseers of an estate that was
            run by a noble or ecclesiastical family. The name "Meyerhoff", when used as its original name "Meierhof", can be broken down into the words "meier" and "hof", which translates
            to the words "administrator" and "court." I believe that during the Middle Ages and/or the Renaissance, someone who worked as an administrator over an estate/town that was held
            by a noble could have been known as a "Meierhof" or as a "Meyerhoff". In this family's case, they might have worked as an administrator in the Lower Saxony or North Rhine-Westphalia
            regions of the Holy Roman Empire.

        <h2>Carl Heinrich Meyerhoff (1843-1919)</h2>

        <p>
            There are several candidates for who Carl's parents might have been. I have the parents on my tree as <b>Katharine Margarethe Koch (1809-1876)</b> and <b>Johann Kasten Meyerhoff (1811-1872)</b>.
            According to the 1870 census, a Henry Meyerhoff (26) lived with his parents, John C. Meyerhoff (61) and Mary Meyerhoff (61). The names are a close resemblance and the dates of birth are similar but not exact.
        </p>

        <h3><center><i>NOTE: Much of this information is speculative. The connection between Carl Meyerhoff (1843-1919) and Heinrich Meyerhoff (1763-1838) is unverified.
            A Celle genealogical database provides much of this information, but provides no source for Johann Kasten Meyerhoff (1811-1872).

        <h2>Johann Kasten Meyerhoff (1811-1872)</h2>

        <p>
            Johann Meyerhoff was born May 3, 1811, in Hanover in Prussia. He was the son of <b>Ilsabe Cathrina Hohls (1765-1829)</b> and <b>Heinrich Dietrich Meyerhoff (1763-1838)</b>. His siblings were:
            <ol>
                <li>Hans Peter Meyerhoff (1789-????)</li>
                <li>Anna Catharina Meyerhoff (1791-????)</li>
                <li>Hans Friedrich Meyerhoff (1793-1797)</li>
                <li>Catharina Dorothea Meyerhoff (1796-1797)</li>
                <li>Catharina Elisabeth Meyerhoff (1800-????)</li>
                <li>Hans Hinrich Meyerhoff (1803-1889)</li>
                <li>Johann Jurgen Meyerhoff (1806-1807)</li>
                <li>Wilhelmina Anna Maria Magdalena (Meyerhoff) Alms (1815-1889)</li>
            </ol>
            Johann passed away on November 4, 1872, in Wine Hill. He was buried in Saint Paul Lutheran Cemetery in Wine Hill.
        </p>

        <p>
            Katharine Koch was born August 21, 1809, in Bergen in Lower Saxony, Germany. I have no information on her family or marriage to Johann. She passed away on November 6, 1876, in Wine Hill, IL. I don't have a burial record.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>There are several issues with this connection.</b> Johann's name is spelt as Meierhoff on his <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/117728182/johann-kasten-meierhoff">Find A Grave profile</a>. Also, as stated
            previously, Johann and Katharine's birth dates listed here don't quite line up with those in the 1870 census. Although those are estimated since only the person's age is typically given, it is normally only one year off.
