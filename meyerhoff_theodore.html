            <p>Theodore C. Meyerhoff was the third child of Carl and Emma (Walter) Meyerhoff, born Thursday, December 14, 1882, in Wine Hill, IL. He married
                Margaretha Agnes Brandt on April 21, 1912, in Campbell Hill, IL. Together they had seven children, listed below. After 36 years of marriage, Margaretha passed away on
                October 4, 1948, at the age of 55. Theodore died 13 years later on January 12, 1962, at the age of 79. Together they were buried in Saint Peter Lutheran Cemetery in Campbell Hill.
            </p>
            
            <p>Margaretha Agnes Brandt was born Monday, December 19, 1892, in Jackson County, IL. She was the daughter of Hinrich Brandt Sr. (1860-1945) and Mina (Golnick) Brandt (1867-1941).
                She was the couple's second child, and was one of nine children. She passed away on October 4, 1948, in Chester, IL. 
            </p>

            <p>Most of my Meyerhoff records come from U.S. census data. In 1900 and 1910, Theodore lived on the Meyerhoff farm in Wine Hill. He married Maggie in 1912 and they raised
                their family on a farm in the Southwestern Precinct of Perry County, IL. This is where the couple are found in the 1920, 1930, and 1940 censuses. In the 1950 census, Maggie had passed
                away, but Theodore (at 67 years old) still worked on the farm with his oldest son Edmund. Meanwhile, his other children on the farm had jobs at the Shoe Factory and brick plant.
