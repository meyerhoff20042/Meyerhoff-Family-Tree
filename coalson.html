                <p>The Coalson family was one of the more challenging families for me to map out. Out of my grandparents, my maternal grandmother's family has moved 
                    around the most in recent generations. Historically from Kentucky, my earliest records indicate the Coalsons lived in the Southern Colonies before the American 
                    Revolution, with my branch eventually moving to Mississippi. As the information on this family is not as reliable as that of other branches, I will take a more 
                    direct approach to discussing this family. I will focus on the lineage that has been mapped out over the years and mention siblings and other theories in passing.
                </p>
                <p>Something to note before diving in to the Coalson family is the spelling of Coalson. "Coalson" is used almost universally in the current generations of the 
                    family, while several centuries ago there were two spellings: both "Coalson" and "Colson" show up on different records. Sometimes these are the result of recordkeeping 
                    errors (census takers weren't always the best spellers), or in other cases the name simply changes over time. I will be using the Coalson spelling in this website as that 
                    is the last name of my branch of the Coalson family and the name I grew up hearing.

                <strong><center>In my research, I found <a href="https://bumgarnergray.com/coalson_family_tree.htm">this great resource</a> on the Coalson family tree.</center></strong>
                <p>This webpage will begin with Alexander Sanders Coalson, as he is the earliest Coalson that I have information for. He was born April 29, 1762, 
                    in Northampton County in the British Colony of North Carolina. He married Bathsheba Futrell (1762-1860?) in 1787 in Northampton County. They were the parents of many 
                    children, of whom four are on my tree and listed below. Alexander passed away on August 20, 1852, in Trigg County, KY, at the age of 90. I am unsure of Bathsheba's death 
                    date; my family tree has it listed as 1860 but I am not confident about that date. They were buried in Sumner Cemetery in Trigg County.

                    <dd>Charity was born in 1791 and married <b>Stephen Boren (1760-1843)</b> in 1809. She passed away in 1870 in Trigg County. Stephen had passed away 27 years earlier in 1843 
                       Trigg County. Together they were buried in Boren Cemetery in Cadiz, KY. Find A Grave lists two children and many grandchildren that comprise the Boren family.

                    <dt><li><strong>Thomas Colson/Coalson (1794-1840)</strong></li></dt>
                    <dd>Thomas was born in 1794 and married <b>Temperence Griffin (1790-1882)</b>. Temperence is the oldest member of the Coalson family of whom I have a picture.
                        Thomas passed away on February 24, 1840, in Trigg County at the age of 45/46. Temperence passed away 42 years later on April 30, 1882, at the age of 91/92. 
                        Thomas was buried in Sumner Cemetery in Trigg County while Temperence was buried in Pleasant Hill Cemetery (also in Trigg County). Find A Grave lists four children of this 
                        couple, using the last name "Colson."

                    <dd>Sarah was the third child of Alexander and Bathsheba, born in 1795 in North Carolina. She married <b>Winborne Futrell (1791-1862)</b>, a veteran of the War of 1812. He passed away 
                        on May 1, 1862, in Trigg County, at the age of 70. Sarah followed him in death 26 years later on May 4, 1888, in Trigg County, at the age of 92/93. They were buried in East 
                        End Cemetery in Cadiz, KY. The Futrell family shows up several times in the Coalson family tree, indicating there were multiple marriages between members of the two 
                        families over the years.

                    <dd>William is the fourth child I have listed for Alexander and Bathsheba, born 1799 in Anson County, NC. He married <b>Malinda Melissa Lindsey (c. 1804 - 1851)</b> on April 9, 1823, 
                        in Trigg, KY. I have seven listed children of the couple below. William passed away on March 22, 1851, in Jackson, MS, at the age of 51/52. 
                        Malinda died the same year, also in Jackson, around the age of 46/47. I do not have a burial record.

                                Together they had eight children, five daughters and three sons:
