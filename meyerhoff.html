    <p>The Meyerhoff family descended from three brothers who immigrated to Randolph County from Germany in the mid-1800s. One of these brothers was the father of
        Carl Heinrich Meyerhoff (1843-1919), where this tree begins. I have mixed details about Carl's parents; my tree has had them listed as Johann Kasten Meyerhoff
        (1811-1872) and Katharine Margarethe (Koch) Meyerhoff (1809-1876) for years. I do not remember where this information came from, so I would take it with a grain of salt.
        However, according to the 1870 census <a href="#s1">[1]</a>, a Henry Meyerhoff (26) lived with his parents, John C. Meyerhoff (61) and Mary Meyerhoff (61). The names are a close resemblance
        and the dates of birth are similar but not exact.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, there is little to no verifiable information about the <a href="meyerhoff_ancestry.html">Meyerhoff ancestors</a> who lived in Germany centuries before they immigrated. There have been 
        some trees passed around online that have various paths, and their evidence usually comes from German church records. The one I see the most lists Carl's paternal 
        grandparents as Heinrich Dietrich Meyerhoff (1763-1838) and Ilsabe Cathrina Hohls (1765-1829), with their ancestries on these trees traced centuries back (the Hohls line 
        having names as far back as 1470!). </p>

    <p>This section of my website will contain almost everything I know about the Meyerhoff family (all deceased relatives, anyway). If you're looking for a book format that
        has much of this information, I've written one called the <a href="Meyerhoff Genealogical Records.pdf">Meyerhoff Genealogical Records</a>.

    <p>Carl Meyerhoff had nine children, three with his first marriage and six with his second. He married Wilhelmine "Minnie" <a href="lindenberg.html">Lindenberg</a> (1851-1877) on December 6,
        1872, in Randolph County <a href="#s2">[2]</a> <a href="#s3">[3]</a>. The couple had three children together:</p>

            <dd>Born October 2, 1873, in Wine Hill, IL <a href="#s5">[5]</a>, Clemens was the first child of Carl Meyerhoff and the first of three children of his father's first marriage. He was 
                the only child of this union to survive to adulthood. He married <b>Henrietta Louise Schrader (1875-1961)</b> on August 12, 1900, in Wine Hill <a href="#s6">[6]</a> <a href="#s7">[7]</a>. Together they had five children:

                </ol>
                Their family moved to Jerome County in Idaho in the 1910s. Clemens passed away on January 30, 1944, in Eden, ID, at the age of 70 <a href="#s5">[5]</a>. Henrietta passed away 17 years later, on 
                January 13, 1961, in Twin Falls, ID, at the age of 85 <a href="#s10">[10]</a>. They were buried in Sunset Memorial Park Cemetery in Twin Falls <a href="#s11">[11]</a> <a href="#s12">[12]</a>.

            <dd>Alvina was Carl and Minnie's second child, born February 20, 1875, in Wine Hill, IL. Church records indicate her full name is Caroline Christine Alvine Meyerhoff, 
                but her gravestone only mentions "Alvina." She passed away at the young age of seven on June 3, 1882 <a href="#s13">[13]</a>, from a combination of whooping cough and typhoid. She was buried in 
                Saint Paul Lutheran Cemetery in Wine Hill <a href="#s14">[14]</a>.

            <dt><li><strong>Herman Clemens Meyerhoff (Mar. 1877 - Apr. 1877)</strong></li></dt>
            <dd>Herman was the third and last child of Carl and Minnie's union, born March 7, 1877, in Wine Hill <a href="#s15">[15]</a>. He was the last child because his mother passed away five days 
                after his birth from winter fever, possibly exacerbated by childbirth complications. Herman did not fare much better; he passed away on April 4, 1877 <a href="#s16">[16]</a>, from 
                tuberculosis (commonly labeled as "consumption"). He was buried in Saint Paul Lutheran Cemetery <a href="#s17">[17]</a>.

        </ol></dl><br>

        <p>After the deaths of his wife and son, Carl remarried to Emma Walter (Walther/Wolter?) (1851-1915) on December 2, 1877, in St. Louis, MO
            <a href="#18">[18]</a> <a href="#s19">[19]</a>. This second marriage produced 
            six children, who all survived to adulthood. I don't know much about Emma's family; her maiden name's spelling is uncertain, and I 
            believe there are three possible iterations of her last name. One possible connection for Emma's parents is the couple William Walter (1815-1886) and Mary Ann McCall 
            (1831-1900) <a href="#s20">[20]</a>, who lived in Ohio but spent some time in Missouri around the time Emma was born.</p>
        <p>Carl Meyerhoff passed away on May 19, 1919, in Wine Hill, at the age of 76 <a href="#s21">[21]</a>. Emma had passed away four years earlier, on November 6, 1915, in Wine Hill, 
            at the age of 64. Together they were buried in Saint Paul Lutheran Cemetery in Wine Hill <a href="#s22">[22]</a> <a href="#s23">[23]</a>.</p>

            <dd>William was the first child of Carl and Emma's marriage, and Carl's fourth child overall. Born on January 4, 1879, in Shiloh Hill <a href="#s24">[24]</a>, he was the only child who 
                survived to adulthood and did not start a family. He moved out to Idaho with several of his other siblings and (along with Clemens) chose to stay. He passed 
                away on May 7, 1936, in Fairfield, ID, at the age of 57 <a href="#s25">[25]</a>. According to his newspaper obituary, he was killed when his wagon overturned and threw him onto a 
                hillside, breaking his back and killing him instantly <a href="#s26">[26]</a>. He was buried in Trinity Lutheran Church Cemetery in Eden, ID <a href="#s27">[27]</a>.
