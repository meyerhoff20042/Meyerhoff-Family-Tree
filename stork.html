            <p>The Stork family has lived in Southern Illinois for 170 years. The patriarch of the Stork family is Johann August Ludwig Stork, born December 19, 1809, in 
                Feudingen, Germany. He married Friederike Emilia Kraft (1811-1892), and together they had five children: Theresa (Stork) Gross (1840-1911), Josephina (Stork) 
                Ellebrecht (1843-1918), Laurentius Stork (1846-1916), Elizabeth Stork (c. 1851 - ????), and John Stork (c. 1854 - ????). Of these five, I will be focusing on 
                Laurentius.</p>

            <p>Johann passed away on January 30, 1876, in Evansville, IL, at the age of 66. Friederike followed him in death 16 years later on January 8, 1892, 
                in Walsh, IL, at the age of 80. They were buried in Old Saint Boniface Catholic Cemetery in Evansville.</p>

            <p>Laurentius was born August 16, 1846, in Gasellgarden, Germany. He immigrated to the United States with his family aboard the ship "Adolph", and arrived 
                on May 6, 1854, when he was seven years old. On May 17, 1870, in Randolph County, he married Bertha Wesbecher (1853-1907), a fellow German immigrant from Au am Rhein. Together they had 
                eight children listed below. Bertha passed away August 31, 1907, in Walsh, IL, at the age of 54. Laurentius followed her in death nine years later on June 25, 1916, 
                in Randolph County, at the age of 69. They were buried in Saint Pius Cemetery in Randolph County.</p>

            <p>An interesting note about the Stork family is their connection with the Pautler family. There are many marriages between the two families that spread over 
                generations. Two of Laurentius's children married Pautlers, along with three of his grandchildren (one from Emelia and two from Lawrence). Lawrence's wife, Hazel, is 
                also a distant cousin of the Pautler family in Southern Illinois.
