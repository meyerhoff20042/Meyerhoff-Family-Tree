            <p>The Sullivan family was one of the easier ones for me to trace, as most of it was (a) already drawn out by previous genealogists and (b) a family of 
                English/Irish descent, meaning they have generally better records than my German branches. I could start centuries back in the Sullivan family if I wished, but to stick 
                with the purpose of this website, I will begin with David Ramsey Sullivan.</p>
            <p>David was born July 27, 1817, in North Carolina. He married Martha E. Campbell (1829-1881) on September 17, 1843, in Hamilton County, IL. Together 
                they had ten children listed below. The couple both passed away within five days of each other: Martha died on March 4, 1881, in Macedonia, IL, at the age of 51, and 
                David died on March 8, 1881, at the age of 63. They were buried in Macedonia Cemetery.</p>
