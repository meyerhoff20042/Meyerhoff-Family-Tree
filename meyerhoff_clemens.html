            Clemens Henry Meyerhoff was the first child of Carl and Minnie Meyerhoff, born October 2, 1873, in Wine Hill, IL. He married Henrietta Louise
            Schrader (1875-1961) on August 12, 1900, in Wine Hill. Together they had five children listed below. Their family moved to Jerome County in Idaho
            in 1914 along with his younger brother Henry. Clemens passed away on January 30, 1944, in Eden ID, at the age of 70.

            Henrietta Louise Schrader was one of the younger children of Dorothea Sophia Conradine Schulze (1835-1913) and Johann Julius Christoph Schrader (1824-1895).
            Her family arrived in New Orleans in 1849 and moved to Southern Illinois shortly after. After celebrating 43 years of marriage and 17 years after the death
            of her husband, Henrietta passed away on January 13, 1961, at the age of 85.

            The couple were buried in Sunset Memorial Park Cemetery in Twin Falls, Idaho. According to my family tree they had five children, 17 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren
            (although I believe that last number to be higher).
