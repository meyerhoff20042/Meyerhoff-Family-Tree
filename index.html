        <p>This is the official website of the Meyerhoff Family Tree, a collection of families, records, pictures, links, and other sources organized by myself
        over the past eight years. Here you can expect to find summaries of those whom I have researched. Many of these people will be members of my extended family,
        and I will primarily discuss my ancestors of the last two centuries.</p>

        <p>For now, this site will cover the Meyerhoff, Coalson, Stork, and Sullivan families as they are the four birth names of my grandparents. Each of these branches have
            bigger families within them, such as the Biermanns on the Meyerhoff side and the Uchtmanns on the Sullivan side. In the future, I may expand this site to include information
            about the families outside of my pedigree chart.</p>
