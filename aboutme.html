            <p>My name is Braden Meyerhoff. I have been doing extensive research on my family tree for five years, and I built this website to attempt to summarize my
                information. Growing up, I was always interested in the family stories my older relatives would tell me, and after a while I created a family tree on a 
                website called Family Echo. This was around 2015, and at the time I had little interest in doing research to draw my family tree. I used it mostly to
                organize family stories and memories into an interactive tree that shows the big picture.</p>

            <p>When I was around 14, I began taking a bigger interest in genealogy. I frequented sites like Find A Grave and WikiTree to help grow the family tree project
                I had had for three years. Through those sites, I learned more about my family than I had in three years of asking my relatives (they know quite a bit, but
                their memories only go so far). I created accounts for both WikiTree and FamilySearch and began contributing to the sites myself using some of the hints I 
                found through earlier research. Through FamilySearch, I was able to expand greatly upon my family tree as unlike Find A Grave and WikiTree, FamilySearch finds
                hints and helps you grow the world tree.</p>
            
            <p>As time went on, I became more experienced in my genealogy work and took a step backward. I looked at the research I had gathered and corrected many of the 
                researching errors that I did not notice back when I first added them. Doing so shrunk my family tree a fair bit, but it gave me newfound confidence in my
                research and I still had a large tree backed by reliable sources.</p> 
                
            <p>Around this time I also began researching royal family trees. I was pretty excited when I encountered my first gateway ancestor and at the time felt pretty 
                special about having a link to royalty. Although I later realized that pretty much everyone has royal roots, it was exciting to know what my connection was 
                and it unlocked a new interest in royal trees for me. I find it fascinating how many of the European royal families can trace their lineages back 1,500 years 
                and that they're all connected in some way.</p>
            
            <p>In 2021 I began working on my first family tree website. I was a senior in high school at the time, and while I had some HTML experience, I had never coded in 
                CSS and still didn't know much about coding in general. I built a basic site but looking back at it now it wasn't quite what I had in mind. Now, I am enrolled 
                in several programming classes at Southwestern Illinois College including CIS-174, which is an introduction to HTML and CSS. This class has greatly expanded my
                web development horizons and I feel like I'm ready to begin this project again.
            </p>
