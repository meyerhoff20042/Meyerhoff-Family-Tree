            <p>My name is Braden Meyerhoff. I have been doing extensive research on my family tree for six years, and I built this website to attempt to summarize my
                information. Growing up, I was always interested in the family stories my older relatives would tell me, and after a while, I created a family tree on a 
                website called Family Echo. This was around 2015, and at the time I was 11 years old and had little interest in researching to draw my family tree. I used it mostly to
                organize family stories and memories into an interactive tree that shows the big picture.</p>

            <p>When I was around 14, I began taking a bigger interest in genealogy. I frequented sites like Find A Grave and WikiTree to help grow the family tree project
                that I had had for three years. Through those sites, I learned more about my family than I had in three years of asking my relatives (they know quite a bit, but
                their memories only go so far). I created accounts for both WikiTree and FamilySearch and began contributing to the sites myself using some of the hints I 
                found through earlier research. Through FamilySearch, I was able to expand greatly upon my family tree as unlike Find A Grave and WikiTree, FamilySearch finds
                hints and helps you grow the world tree.</p>
            
            <p>As time went on, I became more experienced in my genealogy work and took a step backward. I looked at the research I had gathered and corrected many of the 
                research errors that I did not notice back when I first added them. Doing so shrunk my family tree a fair bit, but it gave me newfound confidence in my
                research and I still had a large tree backed by reliable sources.</p> 

            <p>This website is the culmination of many of my efforts to map out my family tree. It is designed to help relatives of mine explore their own ancestry
               and give them a great starting point.</p>
